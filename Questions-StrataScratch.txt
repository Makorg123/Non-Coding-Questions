# Q1: Why is MSE frequently used as a loss function for Linear Regression?
Ans: 
1.MSE is calculated for a linear regression by calculating the squared distance to the regression line (ie the distance from the actual point to the predicted point) 
for each example and computing the mean squared distance for all points. MSE tells you how closely a regression line fits a dataset and can be considered a measure of the quality of 
the estimator.
2.
MSE is frequently used as a loss function for linear regression because it is differentiable, convex, penalizes larger errors more heavily, has a straightforward interpretation, 
and is closely related to maximum likelihood estimation under certain assumptions.
